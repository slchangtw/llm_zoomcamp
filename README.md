# LLM Zoomcamp

This repository documents my progress in the [llm-zoomcamp](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/llm-zoomcamp) course provided by [DataTalks.Club](https://datatalks.club/). Feel free to check out the course and rerun the code in this repository.

## Setting up the environment

1. Create a virtual environment with Python 3.11 and activate it.

```bash
python -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
```

2. Install package manager poetry and install the dependencies. You can check the dependencies in the pyproject.toml file.

```bash
pip install poetry
poetry install
```
